2 BEANS IN A POT

---Food Image Detection and Recipe Finder Web App---


*Unlock the culinary magic with my ingredient-detecting web app and discover a world of delightful recipes at your fingertips!*



Resume:
My final project is a web application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence and web scraping to detect food items in images and provide corresponding recipes. The app utilizes two APIs, Google Cloud Vision API and Clarifai API, to recognize ingredients in food images, and also performs web scraping from the 24 Kitchen website to obtain a diverse dataset of recipes.



Key Features:
Food Image Detection: The app allows users to upload images of food items, which are then processed using Google Cloud Vision API and Clarifai API to identify the ingredients present in the images.

Recipe Finder: After detecting the ingredients in the uploaded images, the app searches its dataset of recipes, obtained through web scraping from the 24 Kitchen website, to find matching recipes for the detected ingredients.

Difficulty and Category Filters: Users can further refine their recipe search by specifying the difficulty level and category (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert) of the desired recipes.



Technologies Used:
Flask, Google Cloud Vision API, Clarifai API, Web Scraping

If you want to try my web app open the folder 'web_flask_pp' run it on Visual Studio. You need to have the apis keys for Cloud Vision and clarifai, they are free and you can easily have them through their websites :-)


The web app serves as an excellent tool for food enthusiasts, helping them discover new recipes based on the ingredients they have at hand, making cooking a delightful experience. Feel free to contact me if you want to contribute to the project and share your ideas to further enhance its capabilities.
